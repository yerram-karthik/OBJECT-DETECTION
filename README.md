# OBJECT_DETECTION

# Object Detection Using OpenCV and Machine Learning 

## Overview
The program is designed to recognize objects in images and perform object detection tasks using Python libraries like OpenCV. It utilizes pre-trained models or allows users to train their own models with labeled datasets.

## Features
- Recognize objects in images
- Perform image classification tasks
- Model evaluation: Performance metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Utilize pre-trained models or train custom models

## Requirements
- Python 
- Libraries: OpenCV,Flask ( for Frontend)
